# Introduction

vfox-terragrunt is a plugin for [vfox](https://vfox.lhan.me/)

this is a low effort project right now. I only tested on my m2 mac.

windows won't work. I don't own a win machine to test / dev.

# Install

After installing vfox, run the following command to add the plugin:

```sh
vfox add --source https://github.com/io-0/vfox-terragrunt/archive/refs/tags/0.1.0.zip
```
